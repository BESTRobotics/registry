# User Management

The registry is intensly user centric.  The user is a 1:1
correspondance to an actual person.  Users can log in and perform
other actions expected in a logged in environment.

## Creating Users

Creating users can be done one of several ways, depending on the
environment in which the user is needed:

### Server Bootstrap

During bootstrap, a special option may be fed to the server which will
cause the creation of a user.  This user will be created with full
administrative powers.

### By the Administrator

From the administrative dashboard, the root administrator can create
users by hand.  This is meanth primarily for testing, or for offline
user where it is desireable to have some admins that don't exist in
the real database.

### By signing up

By far the most common process by which new users will be created is
signing up.  This process will be familiar to most users with the
selection of a username, the creation of a passwords, and the clicking
of a magic link.
