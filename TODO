Break up the backend.  We want to probably move authenticating logic
down into mechgreg, and then move storage manipulation down a layer
below that.  At the same time, the types need to be broken up, we
should probably have a seperate storage and transport type, which need
to be able to convert between each other.

The storage type needs to just store IDs, the transport type is fully
populated.

Need to also add UIL stuff during the refactor.
